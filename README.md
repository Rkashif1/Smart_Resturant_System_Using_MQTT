# Project Proposal: Self-Balancing Robot with ESP32 Camera and Ultrasonic Sensor

## Introduction
Self-balancing robots have emerged as versatile platforms for various applications, including surveillance and security. In this project, we propose to develop a self-balancing robot equipped with an ESP32 camera, ultrasonic sensor, and pressure sensors to ensure stability and obstacle avoidance. Additionally, we plan to utilize MQTT protocol for remote operation and monitoring, with Arduino Uno WiFi serving as the broker. The integration of these components will enable real-time surveillance capabilities and enhance the robot's functionality.

## Components
- ESP32 Camera: For capturing real-time video feed.
- Ultrasonic Sensor: To detect obstacles and enable obstacle avoidance.
- Motor Shield: To control the DC motors for movement and balancing.
- GY-521 MPU-6050 Module: 3-axis gyroscope and acceleration sensor for maintaining balance.
- Battery Shield: To power the robot and facilitate battery charging.
- 2 DC Motors: For propulsion and balancing.
- Arduino Uno WiFi: As the MQTT broker for remote communication.
- LED Lights: For aesthetic appeal and visibility.

## Methodology
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Assemble the robot chassis and mount the components securely.
   - Connect the ESP32 camera, ultrasonic sensor, pressure sensors, and motor shield to the ESP32 microcontroller.
   - Calibrate the sensors and motors for accurate data and control.

2. **Software Development:**
   - Develop firmware for the ESP32 microcontroller to interface with sensors and motors.
   - Implement self-balancing algorithms using data from the MPU-6050 module.
   - Integrate MQTT client functionality to enable remote control and monitoring.
   - Utilize Python scripts with the Python Dash library to create a dashboard for monitoring sensor data and controlling the robot remotely.

3. **Testing and Optimization:**
   - Conduct rigorous testing to ensure the stability and reliability of the self-balancing robot.
   - Optimize the balancing algorithms and obstacle avoidance mechanisms for enhanced performance.
   - Test the MQTT communication to ensure seamless interaction between the robot and the control interface.

## Use Case: Surveillance and Security
Deploy the MQTT-controlled self-balancing robot for patrolling and monitoring areas remotely, providing real-time video feed and sensor data to operators. The robot's ability to maintain stability and navigate obstacles makes it well-suited for surveillance applications in indoor and outdoor environments.

## Conclusion
The proposed project aims to develop a self-balancing robot with advanced features such as obstacle avoidance and real-time video streaming, enabled by components like the ESP32 camera and ultrasonic sensor. By leveraging MQTT protocol for remote control and monitoring, the robot can be deployed for surveillance and security purposes with enhanced efficiency and effectiveness.
